    <h2>About Guitar Runners</h2>
    <p>
      &#160 &#160 &#160 I started Guitar Runners as a way to indulge a passion I've had for more than forty years.
      I started playing guitar, writing songs, and singing when I was in my teens.  As time went on,
      I scrimped and saved and paid my own way through college, to get a computer science degree.
      Along the way, I played my sister's department-store guitar, then eventually bought a
      cheap Japanese electric guitar used, for $35, and then a brand-new Epiphone acoustic
      for the princely sum of $120.  They were all terrible guitars. <br> <br>&#160 &#160 &#160
      Once I had my good-paying job, I was able to finally afford nicer guitars, and I have bought, 
      sold, and fixed up dozens of very nice, and some not so nice ones over the last forty years,
      in my spare time.   My IT career was spent helping people solve computer problems directly at
      customer sites, ('running around') on the road.  While at the same time, in addition to my
      biggest passion, which was raising my family, my other passion was running.  Well, I never
      got incredibly great at either passion - I have run a marathon, but in a very slow time, and
      I've played guitar and bass, and sang in front of a hundred people, but I will never play 
      'the big rooms'... <br> <br>&#160 &#160 &#160 But being famous or running the fastest isn't the point.  I started Guitar
      Runners for the people out there who enjoy playing for the sake of playing.  Like me, they
      might play in church, or with a few friends, or at a party, but they play mostly because
      they like to play.  I retired from my career spent running around working on computers,
      and Guitar Runners is the next act in my life's journey.  The idea of Guitar Runners is
      to run around Northern Ohio and the area around it, buying, selling, fixing, and helping
      people with their guitar playing experience.  Does it make sense for you to spend $80 for
      a guitar setup on a $100 guitar?  Probably not.  But it might make sense for me to show
      you ways you can make that guitar sound better and play easier, so you can save money
      doing it over time - or maybe I can help you get that 'step up' guitar.  And in many
      cases, I can come to you. <br> <br>&#160 &#160 &#160 And maybe we can share some musical ideas too!  I'm glad you 
      came to visit our website here.  Take time to look over all the pages, and don't hesitate 
      to reach out if there's anything that catches your eye.  In a lot of ways it's easier than
      ever to be a passionate guitar player - and I'd love to help you get there!
      <br> <br> 
      Yours in good playing,
      <br> <br>
